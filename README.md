## Development steps:

1. First I recommmend running through the Tauri "Gettting Started" guide
to install the [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

2. This project uses SvelteKit, so run though building the "Quick Start" for [SvelteKit](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

3. This project depends on a newer version of IronRDP than the published crate.
`git clone https://github.com/daniel-heater-imprivata/IronRDP` at the same level as the parent directory for this project.
